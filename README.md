## Facebook100 dataset

The [Facebook100 dataset](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2011.12.021) must be [downloaded](https://archive.org/details/oxford-2005-facebook-matrix) and uncompressed in the `Facebook100` directory. The individual edgelists are extracted by executing the python script `extract_edgelists.py`.

Figures 2 and 3 were generated by running (from their respective folders)

1. the numerical simulation by executing the script `run_simulations.sh`
2. the python script `plot_figure.py`
